# MetroMik

MetroMik is a Digital Metronome I built for my son Michele, hence the name. It's based around a PIC16F1825. Project is made for MPLAB X Ide using XC8 compiler and MPLAB Code Configurator.  

Characteristics:
- Powered by a 18650 LiPo Cell
- Charging circuit
- BPM selection from 10 to 999
- Tempo selections: 2/4, ¾, 4/4
- Menù navigation using a rotary encoder
- 3 digits, 7-Segments led display
- Beating led
- Low battery indication on display

Full project specs [are listed here](https://www.settorezero.com/wordpress/metromik-metronomo-digitale-con-microcontrollore-pic/).  

Here is a video showing how it works:
